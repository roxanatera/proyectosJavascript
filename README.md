# Rock, Paper, or Scissors Game

## Description

This project is a JavaScript implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. It allows a user to play against the computer, which randomly chooses its moves. The main objective of the game is to determine the winner based on the following rules:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

## Purpose

This project serves both educational and practical purposes:
1. **Practice JavaScript**: The code helps beginner developers practice using functions, conditionals, and user-system interaction.
2. **Game logic demonstration**: Several functions are implemented to simulate the game, including user input, random computer choice, and winner determination.
3. **GitHub familiarization**: This repository acts as a reference for publishing and documenting projects on GitHub.

## Main Functions

### 1. `getUserChoice(userInput)`
This function takes the userâ€™s choice (`"rock"`, `"paper"`, or `"scissors"`) and validates it. If the input is valid, it returns it in lowercase; otherwise, it returns an error message.

```javascript
const getUserChoice = (userInput) => { 
  userInput = userInput.toLowerCase();
  if (userInput === "rock" || userInput === "paper" || userInput === "scissors") {
    return userInput;
  } else {
    return "Error!";
  }
};


# Training Days

## Description

The "Training Days" project is a JavaScript program designed to simulate the process of assigning training events and calculating the required days of preparation for an athlete. The program randomly selects an event from a set of sports, then determines how many days the athlete has to train for the chosen event. It also logs this information for multiple athletes.

## Project Overview

In this project:
- An event is randomly selected from three possible options: `Marathon`, `Triathlon`, or `Pentathlon`.
- The number of training days is calculated based on the event:
  - Marathon: 50 days
  - Triathlon: 100 days
  - Pentathlon: 200 days
- The athlete's name, assigned event, and training time are then logged to the console.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of functions, conditionals, and variable scopes in JavaScript. It also practices working with randomization and string interpolation to display relevant information.

### Main Functions

1. **`getRandEvent()`**  
   This function randomly selects and returns one of the three sports events: `"Marathon"`, `"Triathlon"`, or `"Pentathlon"`.

   ```javascript
   const getRandEvent = () => {
     const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
     if (random === 0) {
       return "Marathon";
     } else if (random === 1) {
       return "Triathlon";
     } else if (random === 2) {
       return "Pentathlon";
     }
   };
